# Contributing to Fabricate

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
Any contributions you make will be reflected in this repository's [contributor insights](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/graphs/contributors) as well as [README.md](README.md).

Please be respectful to other contributors and maintainers, as well as module users.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). 
Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

To navigate the codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working on Fabricate](#introduction-to-working-on-fabricate) :confetti_ball:.

Check to see what [types of contributions](#types-of-contributions) we accept before making changes. 
Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Introduction to working on Fabricate

Check out the section on [building Fabricate](README.md#building-fabricate) in [README.md](README.md).
Get your local development environment set-up and the local installation process working.

Ideally, every change should have an Issue where we can discuss the new behaviour and content, as well as potential solutions, before you get started working.
This is even more important for complex or large changes.

Contributions should also be small.
The ideal change size is under 200 new lines of code.
You can still submit larger changes, but you may be asked to break them down to make them easier to review.

Please try to avoid submitting opinionated changes unless the maintainers have requested, or agreed them.
An example of an opinionated change would be switching from Less CSS to Sass, or from Jest to Mocha.
You should expect that those types of changes will be rejected if they have not been discussed with the maintainers beforehand.

### Types of contributions

### :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned, you can join or start a [discussion](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/discussions).

### :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. 
If an issue has a triage label, it hasn't been reviewed yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing or is already working on it. 
If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/issues/new/choose). 
The issue will be used to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/pulls) is a way to suggest changes in the repository. 
When those changes, they become part of the next release. 
The maintainers will decide what and when to release, as well as making it happen.

### :question: Support

I am currently working on Fabricate alone.
Although I'm working hard to keep up with the documentation demands and feature backlog of a continuously changing module, that means I just can't help with support questions in this repository. 
If you have questions about the module and its usage, please join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/P5KVvSNKUZ) and ask in the [#fabricate](https://discord.gg/P5KVvSNKUZ) channel.
There is a small community of people there who can help you out if I'm not able to.

If you're having trouble with Foundry Virtual Tabletop, you should ask in a [Foundry Community](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/home).

### :earth_asia: Translations

This module is internationalized, though there might be places that have been missed.
Fabricate is currently only available in English.
If you want to contribute a translation, please open an Issue and submit a Pull Request.
Translations will need to be reviewed and approved by the community before they can be accepted.
The maintainers will manage and arbitrate this process.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or see an opportunity for a new feature, [search to see if an issue already exists](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/issues). 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/issues) to find one that interests you. 
You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.
As a general rule, issues wonâ€™t be assigned to anyone. 
Instead, we ask contributors to self-assign when they start work on an issue.
If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to self-assign the issue and open a PR with the change.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Install or update to **Node.js v16**
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. 
Don't forget to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template. 
This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, someone will review your proposal. 
They may ask questions or request additional information.
- Ensure that your change passes the CI test and build process.
If it doesn't pass first time, update your change until it does!
- The reviewer may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. 
You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. 
You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [contributor insights](https://github.com/misterpotts/fabricate/graphs/contributors).
