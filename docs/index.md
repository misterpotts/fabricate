# About Fabricate

Fabricate is a system-agnostic, flexible crafting module for FoundryVTT.
The current version is in the late stages of development.
It is working towards back-filling functionality of "Alchemist's Supplies V1.6" by [/u/calculuschild](https://www.reddit.com/user/calculuschild/) for Foundry VVT Version 10+.
Once complete, Fabricate will ship with at least one crafting system for D&D 5E.

Use the left navigation, as well as the search at the top of this page, to learn how to build your own crafting systems using Fabricate.
