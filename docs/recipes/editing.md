## Adding recipes to a crafting system

Adding recipes to a crafting system is an essential first step to configuring them and making them available to users.
Once you've added a recipe, you can define its requirements in terms of ingredients and catalysts, as well as raw essences from amongst other components.

To add a recipe to a crafting system, simply navigate to the "Recipes" tab in the crafting system manager.
This will open the recipe browser. 
Make sure that you've selected the crafting system you want to add the recipes to from the left menu.
Then, simply drag and drop the items into the drop zone beneath "Add a recipe to `{my system}`".
Fabricate will add the recipe to the crafting system and display a notification confirming it was successfully added.
