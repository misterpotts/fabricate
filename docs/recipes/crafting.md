# Crafting
{: .no_toc }

Crafting is the act of transforming one or more components into one or more other components.
Crafting is the fundamental activity for any RPG crafting system, perhaps unsurprisingly.

## Crafting a Recipe

If an item owned by an actor is a Fabricate recipe, the crafting icon will appear in the item sheet header bar.
Click that button on an open item sheet to open the recipe crafting app.

If the recipe has multiple salvage options, you will be able to select an option.
If not, you will see only the one option.
You can click the recipe requirements and results to open their item sheets to see more details, before you make the decision to craft the recipe (or not).

To craft the recipe, just click the "Craft" button in the top right of the recipe crafting app.
Click that, and Fabricate will open a dialogue that prompts you to confirm your decision.
Click “Yes” and Fabricate will remove the consumed components from your inventory (or decrement their quantity, depending on the game system).
Then, it will add the recipe results to your inventory.

You can skip the confirmation dialogue by holding the shift key when you click the craft button.
This is particularly useful when you want to craft the same recipe multiple times.
