# Components

These are the Items that your crafting system consumes and produces. 
They can be consumables, like potions, or equipment.
They might be gear, such as armour and weapons. 
Equally, they can be trinkets used as ingredients, such as "Iron Ore" or an "Adult Blue Dragon Tooth".

Your system **must** have Components to operate.
Otherwise, it can't produce anything.

Components also have the ability to be "Salvaged".
Salvage for a component defines which components(if any) can be produced by breaking down another.
