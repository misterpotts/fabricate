# Salvaging
{: .no_toc }

Salvaging is the act of breaking down one component into one or more other components.
It can be used to represent harvesting, as well as recovering materials through recycling.

## Salvaging a component

If a component is salvageable, the salvage icon will appear in the item sheet header bar for an owned item.
Click that button on an open item sheet to open the component salvage app.

If the component has multiple salvage options, you will be able to select an option.
If not, you will see only the one option.
You can click the salvage results to open their item sheets to see more details, before you make the decision to salvage the component (or not). 

To salvage the component, just click the "Salvage" button in the top right of the component salvage app.
Click that, and Fabricate will open a dialogue that prompts you to confirm your decision. 
Click “Yes” and Fabricate will remove the salvaged component (or decrement its quantity, depending on the game system).
Then, it will add the salvage results to your inventory.

You can skip the confirmation dialogue by holding the shift key when you click the delete button. 
This is particularly useful when you have a lot of the same type of item to salvage.
